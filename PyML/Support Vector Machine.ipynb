    "In a nutshell, a Support Vector Machine distinguishes between classes by drawing a boundary (we call this, a hyperplane) such that the distance between any class with this boundary has been maximized. In a 2-dimensional space, this boundary is a linear line, whereas in case of 3-dimensional space, this boundary is said to be a plane.\n",

Similarly, if $X_{1}$ were to end up at the (towards) positive side of the hyperplane, the corresponding class (say $C_{2}$) can be designated for $X_{1}$."
